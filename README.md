# Packito
My complete android application which is related to lists of things that one can get in any case.

# Description
Welcome to Packito! It's an application that makes it easy for you to have a ready-made list of the items you want to take in any situation. Either this will be a trip or a move respectively. But the most interesting thing is that each case you choose is unique and the actions you take concern only that specific case. Apart from that, it also makes it easier for you in case you want to pick up some items the next day.

What does the app do about it?

Unlike you, it doesn't forget and the items you chose the previous day will already be stored so you won't forget anything. Only in case of liquidation the list data is deleted.

I am using local storage without the database subscription!
